# Programming-problems-solutions-algorithms-datastructures
Explanation how I solved some problems from the area of competitive programming and some useful implementation of algorithms/data structures in C++ (e.g. big integer)

Things I am working on to add:
- 2D array (multiple dimmension array) implemeted with single consecutive array.
- priority queue with update
