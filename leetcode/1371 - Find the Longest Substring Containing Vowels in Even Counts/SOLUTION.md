The trick is in the number of vovels. It is only 5. Therefore all the combination of evenness can fit into 5 bits - which can be represented as an array of 32 elements. We can then just remember the leftmost occurance of a specific comination of even/odd vovels and as we iterate throu the array and keep track of the evenness of ourvovels we can check for the complement and its position and then just remember the longest occurance.
